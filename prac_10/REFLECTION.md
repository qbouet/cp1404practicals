# CP1404 Practicals Reflection

## Regarding the estimates that you did for practical tasks, how was your accuracy and did your accuracy improve during the course of the subject?
To be honest, my accuracy was not very good, as I would usually underestimate the time it took me to finish the practical tasks

## Regarding code reviews, what have you learned from both being reviewed and doing reviews?
I have learnt that doing code reviews and being reviewed only works if both parties participate, meaning that they dedicate time and effort to doing the practicals and being active on github.

## Regarding the practical tasks overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?
I would mark the practicals out of 100 (like a percentage) instead of out of 4.

## Two PRs that show me doing good code reviews for any of the past practicals:
